# Oinos-Modular-Double-pane-Lack-Enclosure
## This is a pre-production version for the purposes of getting feedback while I design my new enclosure. ##

This is inspired in some way by the original Prusa Lack enclosure (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2864118).

Why am I spending so much time making yet an other enclosure. Short answer, because I couldn't find what I wanted.
This is a modular enclosure that allows you to access your printer from any side.
Each "face" of the enclosure can swap places, or be swapped by a different type.
* You can change access slots or temperature management for different materials/printers.
* If you reconfigure your room you can easily swap face as needed.
* You can connect multiple enclosures.
* You can add upgrades for filament management.

The design also has slots for TWO plates on each face, to better isolate heat and noise.
The slots are 3mm so you can use any material. it accounts for 6mm of space in between which you can leave empty or decide to add some isolating material.
Additionally you can add soundproofing as there is space for that as well on the inner wall.

All faces attach to the enclosure by snuggly fitting in and held by magnets on each corner.
The design accounts for the imperfect width of the legs of the Lack table and you can easily cut the center rails.

Objectives:

* Modular [X]
* Easy to open in tight spaces [ ]
  - Need to design handles that can be easy to attach and remove. I have an idea in mind.
  - You can add the magnetic square holders to the bottom to easily store the face underneath while open
* Accessibility of all sides [X]
* Light rails [ ]
  - An easy way to mount any LED strip without having to glue or nail it.
* Air Filter [ ]
  - There are a few designs out there and I probably will just use that.
* Air extraction vent with one direction flow vent [ ]
  - Because I intend to print ASA and my enclosure is in my home office I want to vent fumes before opening. But I don't want drafts from outside to push cold air. I'm thinking on using a gravity vent to block negative flow.
* Heating [ ]
  - Will need to add clips or racks.
* Retains temperature [X]
  - Double pane
* Better noise isolation [X]
  - Double pane
* Easy cable management without big gaps [ ]
* Display Temp/Humidity [ ]
* Easy to disasemble and transport [X]
  - The magnetic faces dismount easily and the plastic base is easy to unscrew
* Spool management [ ]
